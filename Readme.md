# Touchpad Scrolling

FoundryVTT module to change mouse scroll behavior to better support touchpads. Note that this will change overall
 behavior, so you might not want this for non-touchpad users. Maybe it should be a player setting, come to think of it?
 
- Vertical mouse scroll will now pan up and down (instead of zooming)
- Horizontal mouse scroll will now pan left and right
- Panning with two fingers on a touchpad should use these two and should be nicer
- Ctrl+scroll will now zoom in and out (like previous vertical scroll) (instead of finely rotating a token)
- Pinching with two fingers on a touchpad should use this and should be nice
- Ctrl+Shift+scroll will now finely rotate a token (like previous ctrl+scroll)
